# Learning Web Scraping

This repository is my journey on learning how to scrape the internet for content. I'm following [Scrapy Course â€“ Python Web Scraping for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBoX_JCKZTE) by freeCodeCamp.org to learn the basics which are shown here.

# Milestones

The intention behind this is to build a portfolio repository with an agragate of features and technologies to showcase my skills and determination. For this specific part, I have a few milestones I'd like to achieve:
- **Complete the full course available on provided link above**
  
Yes, it's important to complete the basic and to know the basic, so completing the course is one important step on this journey.
 
- **Develop another web scraping project to look for car information on the web**
  
As a result of previous learning, implement a new vision with more complex data to filter through and little assistance provided for the specific case scenario. A proof of learning.
  
- **Report**
  
Though the previous step should be able fulfill any doubts on capacity and skills acquired, I need to be able to report my doings and learnings in a simple way.

# Considerations

As I am here a project manager, product owner and developer, it would be easy to fall for "I understand it so it's good enough", but my intentions here are based on a corporate situation. I'm considering this a job I need to do, hence I need to able to report and complete tasks on a timely manner with discipline and organization.

# Call to action

If you found me and are just visiting, further information might be provided later on but by all means: ask, suggest or criticize.

If you actually found me due to me sending a CV to your company, talk to me about other works I've done not using this account, as I've created accounts using corporate emails in the past as a way to not mix work + personal business. Let me tell you more about the things I've done in the big hiatus seen here on the other repositories.
